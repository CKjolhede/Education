# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# School.destroy_all
# Student.destroy_all
# school_1 = School.create!(name: "City High School", census: 200)
# school_2 = School.create!(name: "City Middle School", census: 97)
# school_3 = School.create!(name: "City Grade School", census: 104)
